# Methodological Decision Log

## D-001: Proceed from Gaussian MI validation to Stage 1 chartering

Date: 2026-08-28

Stage: R1 / Stage 0.1

Status: PROCEED

Decision timing: Predeclared gate evaluated after results

Question: Is the in-repository bivariate KSG-1 estimator viable at the
intended continuous Gaussian sample-size regime?

Prior specification: `docs/stage0_charter.md` fixed the conditions, 500
replicates, development-only k selection, and validation-only proceed gate
before results were generated.

Evidence: `results/generated/stage0_gaussian/decision.json` records 72,000
estimates, zero estimator errors, selected `k=20`, maximum moderate-signal
absolute bias of 0.0134 nats, maximum moderate-signal RMSE of 0.0452 nats,
Spearman strength ranking of 1.00, and null 95th percentile of 0.0213 nats.

Decision: Proceed to a new frozen Stage 1 charter for tolerant-DPI chain,
measured-fork, and true-triangle motif validation.

Rationale: All predeclared Stage 0.1 validation criteria passed. This decision
is limited to the tested continuous Gaussian estimator regime.

Consequences: Do not add screening, bootstrap, mixed-type, synergy, or public
network API layers. Stage 1 must receive its own DGPs, thresholds, seeds, and
stop/reassess gate before implementation.

## D-002: Reassess tolerant-DPI motif validation

Date: 2026-08-28

Stage: R2 / Stage 1

Status: REASSESS

Decision timing: Predeclared gate evaluated after results

Question: Does tolerance-modified DPI remove observed transitive dependencies
from continuous Gaussian chains and measured forks without pruning genuine
conditional-dependence triangle edges, for some adjacent tolerance pair?

Prior specification: `docs/stage1_charter.md` froze the chain/fork/triangle
DGPs, `N` grid, strengths, tau grid `[0, .05, .10, .15, .20, .25, .30, .40,
.50]`, 500 replicates, development/validation replicate split, and the
proceed gate (chain/fork TPR `>= .80` and triangle FPR `<= .10` at `N >= 500`
for two adjacent tau values) before results were generated.

Evidence: `results/generated/stage1_dpi/decision.json` records 243,000 raw
estimates, zero estimator/DGP/Cholesky errors, and
`"no eligible development tau pair"`. Pooled development-replicate metrics
(`N in [500, 750, 1000]`) show chain/fork indirect-edge pruning TPR `>= .938`
at every tau, but triangle true-edge pruning FPR never drops below `.117`,
even at `tau = .50`, the top of the frozen grid. See
`docs/stage1_report.md` for the full per-tau breakdown.

Decision: Reassess. Do not select a public default tau, and do not proceed to
Stage 2 candidate-edge screening on this evidence.

Rationale: The binding failure is triangle true-edge over-pruning, not
chain/fork under-pruning or estimator/sample-size failure. Tolerant DPI, as
chartered, cannot reach a jointly passing tau within the tested range; the
FPR floor near `tau = .50` does not improve with `N`, indicating a mechanism
property rather than an incomplete or noisy run. Extrapolating past the
frozen tau grid would not be a valid post hoc adjustment under this charter.

Consequences: Stage 2 candidate-edge screening, bootstrap reproducibility,
and later layers remain blocked. Any further tolerant-DPI work requires a new
charter — for example, a wider or differently shaped tolerance grid, or a
reconsidered pruning rule for the triangle motif — frozen before new results,
per the outline's mechanism-by-mechanism falsification requirement.
