# Methodological Decision Log

## D-001: Proceed from Gaussian MI validation to Stage 1 chartering

Date: 2026-08-28

Stage: R1 / Stage 0.1

Status: PROCEED

Decision timing: Predeclared gate evaluated after results

Question: Is the in-repository bivariate KSG-1 estimator viable at the
intended continuous Gaussian sample-size regime?

Prior specification: `docs/stage0_charter.md` fixed the conditions, 500
replicates, development-only k selection, and validation-only proceed gate
before results were generated.

Evidence: `results/generated/stage0_gaussian/decision.json` records 72,000
estimates, zero estimator errors, selected `k=20`, maximum moderate-signal
absolute bias of 0.0134 nats, maximum moderate-signal RMSE of 0.0452 nats,
Spearman strength ranking of 1.00, and null 95th percentile of 0.0213 nats.

Decision: Proceed to a new frozen Stage 1 charter for tolerant-DPI chain,
measured-fork, and true-triangle motif validation.

Rationale: All predeclared Stage 0.1 validation criteria passed. This decision
is limited to the tested continuous Gaussian estimator regime.

Consequences: Do not add screening, bootstrap, mixed-type, synergy, or public
network API layers. Stage 1 must receive its own DGPs, thresholds, seeds, and
stop/reassess gate before implementation.

## D-002: Reassess tolerant-DPI motif validation

Date: 2026-08-28

Stage: R2 / Stage 1

Status: REASSESS

Decision timing: Predeclared gate evaluated after results

Question: Does tolerance-modified DPI remove observed transitive dependencies
from continuous Gaussian chains and measured forks without pruning genuine
conditional-dependence triangle edges, for some adjacent tolerance pair?

Prior specification: `docs/stage1_charter.md` froze the chain/fork/triangle
DGPs, `N` grid, strengths, tau grid `[0, .05, .10, .15, .20, .25, .30, .40,
.50]`, 500 replicates, development/validation replicate split, and the
proceed gate (chain/fork TPR `>= .80` and triangle FPR `<= .10` at `N >= 500`
for two adjacent tau values) before results were generated.

Evidence: `results/generated/stage1_dpi/decision.json` records 243,000 raw
estimates, zero estimator/DGP/Cholesky errors, and
`"no eligible development tau pair"`. Pooled development-replicate metrics
(`N in [500, 750, 1000]`) show chain/fork indirect-edge pruning TPR `>= .938`
at every tau, but triangle true-edge pruning FPR never drops below `.117`,
even at `tau = .50`, the top of the frozen grid. See
`docs/stage1_report.md` for the full per-tau breakdown.

Decision: Reassess. Do not select a public default tau, and do not proceed to
Stage 2 candidate-edge screening on this evidence.

Rationale: The binding failure is triangle true-edge over-pruning, not
chain/fork under-pruning or estimator/sample-size failure. Tolerant DPI, as
chartered, cannot reach a jointly passing tau within the tested range; the
FPR floor near `tau = .50` does not improve with `N`, indicating a mechanism
property rather than an incomplete or noisy run. Extrapolating past the
frozen tau grid would not be a valid post hoc adjustment under this charter.

Consequences: Stage 2 candidate-edge screening, bootstrap reproducibility,
and later layers remain blocked. Any further tolerant-DPI work requires a new
charter — for example, a wider or differently shaped tolerance grid, or a
reconsidered pruning rule for the triangle motif — frozen before new results,
per the outline's mechanism-by-mechanism falsification requirement.

## D-003: Reassess conditional-independence motif validation (Stage 1b / R2b)

Date: 2026-08-28

Stage: R2b / Stage 1b

Status: REASSESS

Decision timing: Predeclared gate evaluated after results

Question: Does pruning by each edge's own conditional-independence test
(Gaussian partial correlation, exact for conditional MI on this DGP) fix the
D-002 failure, where magnitude-ratio DPI could not distinguish a real-but-
weaker triangle edge from a fake indirect one?

Prior specification: `docs/stage1b_charter.md` froze the same chain/fork/
triangle DGPs, `N` grid, strengths, 500 replicates, and development/
validation split as the R2 charter, substituting an `alpha` grid `[.0001,
.001, .005, .01, .05, .10, .20, .30, .50]` and the same proceed gate
structure (chain/fork TPR `>= .80`, triangle FPR `<= .10`, two adjacent
alphas, all validation cells).

Evidence: `results/generated/stage1b_dpi/decision.json` records 243,000 raw
estimates, zero errors, and selection of adjacent pair `(0.05, 0.10)` on
pooled development data, failing one validation criterion (triangle
genuine-edge pruning FPR) at `strong`-family cells: `alpha=.05` at `N=500,
750`, and `alpha=.10` at `N=500`. Unlike D-002, the pooled development
curves for chain/fork TPR and triangle FPR now overlap in a shared feasible
region (`alpha` roughly `[.05, .20]`), and the `balanced`/`moderate`
triangle families pass cleanly. The `strong` family's FPR improves
monotonically with `N` at every alpha (e.g., `alpha=.05`: `.187` at `N=500`
down to `.111` at `N=1000`, development replicates), unlike D-002's
`N`-invariant floor. See `docs/stage1b_report.md` for the full breakdown.
Exploratory (non-gating) calibration of the confidence score `1 - p_value`
against ground truth gives a pooled Brier score of `.081` (naive-baseline
`.25`), improving with `N`.

Decision: Reassess. Do not select a public default alpha, and do not
proceed to Stage 2 candidate-edge screening on this evidence.

Rationale: This result confirms the D-002 diagnosis — the R2 failure was the
magnitude-ratio comparison confusing "weaker but real" with "fake," not an
inherent limit of DPI-style pruning. Testing each edge's own conditional
dependence resolves two of three triangle fixtures outright and narrows the
third to specific small-`N` cells with a trend, not a floor. That is real
progress, but it does not meet the frozen gate on this grid, and the charter
does not permit selecting a different `N` floor or alpha resolution after
seeing results.

Consequences: Stage 2 and later layers remain blocked. A follow-up charter
extending the `N` floor or refining the alpha grid near `[.05, .10]` — frozen
before new results, per the outline's mechanism-by-mechanism rule — is a
reasonable next step given the trend evidence. Separately, the calibration
result is promising enough to be worth a dedicated future charter for a
confidence-scored edge representation, per `docs/stage1b_charter.md`'s
consequences section; this remains an executive decision, not an automatic
next step.

## D-004: Reassess higher-N-floor conditional-independence validation (Stage 1c / R2c)

Date: 2026-08-28

Stage: R2c / Stage 1c

Status: REASSESS

Decision timing: Predeclared gate evaluated after results

Question: Does raising the gate's minimum sample size from `N = 500` to
`N = 750` resolve D-003's failure, where the `strong`-family triangle FPR
cleared the gate at `N = 750`/`1000` but not `N = 500`, improving
monotonically with `N`?

Prior specification: `docs/stage1c_charter.md` froze R2b's DGP, mechanism,
seeds, and alpha grid, extending `sample_sizes` with `N = 1500, 2000` and
raising the gate floor to `N >= 750`, decided from the shape of the R2b
trend before any new evidence.

Evidence: `results/generated/stage1c_dpi/decision.json` records 324,000 raw
estimates, zero errors. Development selection chose adjacent pair `(0.005,
0.01)`, which fails validation on triangle FPR at `strong`-family cells
`N = 750, 1000`. Reading `strong`-family FPR at fixed `alpha` across the
full extended `N` range (development replicates) shows a clean, continuing
decline — `alpha = .05`: `.187` (`N=500`) to `.015` (`N=2000`); `alpha =
.10`: `.141` to `.007` — confirming the sample-size/power hypothesis
directly. The gate nonetheless failed because development selection scans
`alpha` ascending and returns the first pair whose **pooled** average across
all `N >= 750` and all strengths clears both thresholds; at `alpha =
.005`/`.01`, strong performance at the newly added `N = 1500`/`2000` cells
pulled the pooled average under the FPR threshold even though `N =
750`/`1000` alone remained above it. `(0.05, 0.10)` would have passed every
validation cell individually with real margin but was never reached, because
the ascending scan stops at the first pooled-passing pair. See
`docs/stage1c_report.md` for the full breakdown. Exploratory calibration
(Brier score, non-gating) stayed stable and well below the naive baseline
(`.25`) across the full `N` range (`.073`-`.094`).

Decision: Reassess. Do not select a public default alpha or `N` floor, and
do not proceed to Stage 2 candidate-edge screening on this evidence.

Rationale: The charter's scientific question — is the R2b failure a
sample-size/power limitation — is answered yes, clearly, by the fixed-alpha
trend. But the formal PROCEED/REASSESS gate is decided by the frozen
development-selection rule, and that rule's pooled-average selection is
blind to per-`N` variation once a wide, heterogeneous `N` range is pooled
together — the same blind spot D-002 identified between pooled-family and
per-family evidence, now appearing between pooled-`N` and per-`N`. Per this
charter, seeing that `(0.05, 0.10)` would have passed cannot be used to
retroactively substitute it for the rule's actual selection; that would be
exactly the kind of post hoc re-selection the process forbids.

Consequences: Stage 2 and later layers remain blocked. The natural next
charter is a revision to the *development-selection rule itself* — for
example, requiring every individual `N` cell (not just the pooled average)
to clear the threshold before an alpha pair is eligible — frozen before new
results. This is a change to the evaluation methodology, not the pruning
mechanism, which the accumulated R2b/R2c evidence supports well. The
confidence-scored-edge-representation option from D-003 remains open and
unaffected by this result.

## D-005: Reassess per-cell development selection (Stage 1d / R2d)

Date: 2026-08-28

Stage: R2d / Stage 1d

Status: REASSESS

Decision timing: Predeclared gate evaluated after results

Question: Does requiring every individual `(N, strength)` development cell
to pass (not just the pooled average) find an adjacent alpha pair that R2c's
pooled rule missed?

Prior specification: `docs/stage1d_charter.md` froze a change to the
development-selection rule only — an alpha is eligible only if every
individual cell, `N >= 750`, passes both criteria. DGP, mechanism, seeds,
`N` grid, and alpha grid are unchanged from R2c; R2c's raw evidence is
reused verbatim rather than re-simulated.

Evidence: `results/generated/stage1d_dpi/decision.json` records
`"no eligible development alpha pair"`. Checking every alpha individually:
only `alpha = 0.10` is per-cell eligible, with no adjacent eligible partner.
`alpha = .05` fails only two cells (both `strong`-family, FPR `.117`/`.111`
against the `.10` gate); `alpha = .20` fails several chain/fork TPR cells,
all in the `.76`-`.80` range against the `.80` gate. With 250 development
replicates per cell, the binomial standard error is `~.025` at `.80` and
`~.019` at `.10`; every failing cell above misses its threshold by less
than one standard error. See `docs/stage1d_report.md` for the full
breakdown.

Decision: Reassess. Do not select a public default alpha, and do not
proceed to Stage 2 candidate-edge screening on this evidence.

Rationale: This is a third distinct finding, different in kind from D-002
(structural confound) and D-004 (pooling artifact). The per-cell rule,
honestly applied, finds a single isolated passing alpha surrounded by
near-misses consistent with replicate-count sampling noise rather than a
systematic gap. That points at the development replicate count (250 per
cell) being too small for a per-cell decision rule at this alpha grid's
resolution, not at a remaining flaw in the conditional-independence
mechanism, which by this point has been supported by three converging
lines of evidence (D-003's balanced/moderate pass, D-004's power trend to
near-zero FPR, and D-005's isolated-but-clean single point).

Consequences: Stage 2 and later layers remain blocked. Two legitimate next
directions, each requiring its own charter frozen before new results: (a)
more development replicates (the mechanism and grid are unchanged, so this
is a straightforward re-run at higher replicate count, not a new design),
or (b) a coarser alpha grid step that does not require resolving a boundary
this fine. Given the accumulated evidence, this looks like a matter of
statistical resolution rather than a mechanism or methodology problem. The
confidence-scored-edge-representation option from D-003 remains open and
unaffected by this result.
